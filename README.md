Welcome to Totally Accurate Physics Simulator
A Game made by Abraham Diaz, Aram Galarza and Arnau Lucena for the 3rd Assigment of the Physics II of the UPC's degree of Videogame Design and Development.

	-WASD: to move around
	-R: when you die, you can press R to respawn at the beginning of the game.

	-F2: turn on Godmode which makes you ignore collisions.
	-F11: Kill the ship.
	

The Goals: 
	-Succesfully leave the Earth: Watch out, its gravity field might be hard to leave due to drag and gravity itself! don't crash on your own take off platform
	-Land on the moon: while moons gravity is more permisive than earth's and there is no drag force to worry about, you can still go too fast, after all, Moon is still a huge rock that will crush you if given the chance.
	-Go back and land on the Water: The mission will be considered a success when you land the provided prototype in the water
